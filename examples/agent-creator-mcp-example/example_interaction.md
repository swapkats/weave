# Example Interaction: Creating a Research Summarizer Agent

This document shows a complete walkthrough of creating an agent using the Agent Creator MCP server.

## Scenario

A user wants to create an agent that reads research papers and generates concise summaries highlighting key findings, methodology, and conclusions.

## Complete Interaction

### Starting the Session

**User:**
> I need to create an agent that can summarize research papers. Can you help me set this up?

**Agent Designer:**
> Of course! I'll guide you through creating a Weave agent for summarizing research papers. Let me start an interactive session.

*[Tool Call: start_agent_creation(session_id="research-summary-001")]*

```json
{
  "status": "started",
  "message": "Agent creation session started! I'll guide you through creating a Weave agent.",
  "next_question": {
    "step": 0,
    "question": "What is the name of your agent?",
    "field": "agent_name",
    "hint": "Choose a descriptive name (e.g., 'researcher', 'writer', 'analyzer')",
    "example": "content_researcher"
  }
}
```

**Agent Designer:**
> Great! Let's get started. First question:
>
> **What is the name of your agent?**
>
> Choose a descriptive name like 'researcher', 'writer', or 'analyzer'.
> Example: content_researcher

### Question 1: Agent Name

**User:**
> research_summarizer

**Agent Designer:**

*[Tool Call: answer_question(session_id="research-summary-001", answer="research_summarizer")]*

```json
{
  "status": "continue",
  "message": "Answer recorded: research_summarizer",
  "next_question": {
    "step": 1,
    "question": "What is the purpose of this agent?",
    "field": "description",
    "hint": "Describe what this agent does in 1-2 sentences",
    "example": "Researches topics and gathers relevant information"
  },
  "progress": "1/8 questions answered"
}
```

**Agent Designer:**
> Perfect! (Progress: 1/8)
>
> **What is the purpose of this agent?**
>
> Describe what this agent does in 1-2 sentences.

---

### Question 2: Description

**User:**
> Analyzes research papers and creates concise summaries that highlight key findings, methodology, and conclusions for quick understanding

**Agent Designer:**

*[Tool Call: answer_question(session_id="research-summary-001", answer="Analyzes research papers and creates concise summaries that highlight key findings, methodology, and conclusions for quick understanding")]*

```json
{
  "status": "continue",
  "message": "Answer recorded",
  "next_question": {
    "step": 2,
    "question": "Which LLM model should this agent use?",
    "field": "model",
    "hint": "Choose from: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-haiku",
    "example": "gpt-4"
  },
  "progress": "2/8 questions answered"
}
```

**Agent Designer:**
> Excellent description! (Progress: 2/8)
>
> **Which LLM model should this agent use?**
>
> Available options:
> - gpt-4 (most capable, slower)
> - gpt-3.5-turbo (fast, cost-effective)
> - claude-3-opus (best reasoning)
> - claude-3-sonnet (balanced performance)
> - claude-3-haiku (fastest, efficient)

### Question 3: Model

**User:**
> claude-3-sonnet

**Agent Designer:**

*[Tool Call: answer_question(session_id="research-summary-001", answer="claude-3-sonnet")]*

    "question": "What tools should this agent have access to?",
    "field": "tools",
    "hint": "Comma-separated list. Available: web_search, calculator, text_length, json_validator, string_formatter",
    "example": "web_search, summarizer"
  },
  "progress": "3/8 questions answered"
}
```

**Agent Designer:**

### Question 4: Tools

**User:**
> text_length, string_formatter

**Agent Designer:**

*[Tool Call: answer_question(session_id="research-summary-001", answer="text_length, string_formatter")]*

```json
{
  "status": "continue",
  "message": "Answer recorded: text_length, string_formatter",
  "next_question": {
    "step": 4,
    "question": "What temperature should the model use? (0.0-1.0)",
    "field": "temperature",
    "hint": "Lower = more deterministic, Higher = more creative. Default is 0.7",
    "example": "0.7"
  },
  "progress": "4/8 questions answered"
}
```

**Agent Designer:**
> Great tool selection for summarization! (Progress: 4/8)
>
> **What temperature should the model use? (0.0-1.0)**
>
> - Lower values (0.1-0.3): More focused, deterministic, factual
> - Medium values (0.4-0.7): Balanced creativity and consistency
> - Higher values (0.8-1.0): More creative and varied outputs
>
> For summarization, lower temperatures work well.

    # Analyzes research papers and creates concise summaries that highlight key findings, methodology, and conclusions for quick understanding
    model: "claude-3-sonnet"
