  Clean Code Principles:

  1. Meaningful Names
     - Use intention-revealing names
     - Avoid abbreviations and single letters (except i, j, k in loops)
     - Use searchable names for constants
     - Don't encode types in names (no Hungarian notation)
     - Class names: nouns (User, Account)
     - Function names: verbs (getUserData, processPayment)

  2. Functions
     - Keep functions small (< 20 lines ideal)
     - Do one thing and do it well
     - One level of abstraction per function
     - Minimize parameters (0-3 ideal, avoid > 3)
     - No side effects (or make them explicit)
     - Command-Query Separation

  3. Comments
     - Code should be self-explanatory
     - Comment "why" not "what"
     - Remove commented-out code
     - Update comments when changing code
     - Use docstrings for public APIs

  4. Formatting
     - Consistent indentation (spaces over tabs)
     - Group related code together
     - Vertical whitespace for readability
     - Horizontal alignment not necessary
     - Line length < 100 characters

  5. Error Handling
     - Use exceptions, not error codes
     - Don't return null (use Optional/Result types)
     - Write try-catch-finally correctly
     - Provide context in exceptions
     - Don't ignore caught exceptions

  6. Classes
     - Small and focused
     - Single Responsibility Principle
     - High cohesion
     - Low coupling
     - Organize: constants → variables → methods

  7. Code Smells to Avoid
     - Long methods/classes
     - Duplicate code
     - Dead code
     - Magic numbers
     - Deep nesting
     - Feature envy
     - Inappropriate intimacy

examples:
  - "Refactor long function into smaller, focused functions"
  - "Replace magic numbers with named constants"
  - "Rename variables for clarity (x → customerName)"
  - "Extract complex conditionals into well-named functions"
